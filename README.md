# 🕰️ Time Traveler Git
 🌌 Main Timeline: The "Boring" Stable Universe.
 Welcome to the **default reality** where:
- Gravity works (most of the time)
- Python packages never conflict... just kidding 😅
- `git merge` actually succeeds on first try (unlike other timelines)

⚠️ Warning
Merging other timelines may cause:
+ print("Dinosaurs writing quantum code!")
- print("Stable universe terminated")

- - ## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```python
def reality_status():
    print("""
    ✅ Stable Python 3.11.4
    ✅ No dinosaur developers
    ✅ Steam engines optional
    ✅ Zero quantum bugs (for now)
    """)
